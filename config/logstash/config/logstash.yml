# ----------- Core Paths -----------
#path.data: /var/lib/logstash       # Where LS stores its internal state - use default for now
#path.logs: /var/log/logstash       # Log output - use default for now

# ----------- Pipeline Configuration -----------
pipeline.batch.size: 125           # Tune based on your instance size (t3.xlarge is good here)
pipeline.workers: 4                # Matches vCPU count on t3.xlarge
pipeline.ordered: false            # Enables parallel event processing
pipeline.batch.delay: 5
queue.type: persisted              # durable disk-based buffering between inputs and filters/outputs
queue.max_bytes: 2gb               # Rule of thumb: use 25%â€“50% of available disk on /var/lib/logstash/queue if you want high resiliency.
queue.max_events: 2000


# ----------- Log Level -----------
log.level: info
